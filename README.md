# Sven
Sven, An innovation of a smart vending machine 

Hello my name is Cooper McCaffrey and I am a sophomore at Wyomissing area highschool. Lately I have been working on my Sven project for professor Minich's class. I have implicated multiple upgrades for Sven. These upgrades are described below and  also shown in my repl.it link.

For my upgrades I improved the interface of the Sven demo. In order to do this I obtained the skeleton ASCII art from http://www.angelfire.com/co/cajhnesplace/ascii/vend.html and heavily customized it to fit the look of Sven. I then implicated the ASCII art into the program by using a display method used on line 222. It is titled ```displayMachine()```. I then went line by line copying each section of the ASCII art and adding them into the interface by using 29 System.out.println statements on lines 224-252. After that, I added the ASCII art into Minich's code Jack H got the great idea to color the ASCII art in order to make it even more appealing to the user and match the program. I also helped Justin K with his easter egg by putting a secret message into my ASCII art on the side of the vending machine. This easter egg is triggered when the user types in "Minich" at any time. This then causes a small game of hangman to pop up in order for the user to play before or after they order from Sven. Finally, I helped update Seamus's ASCII art in order or the letters in "Sven" to display better.
